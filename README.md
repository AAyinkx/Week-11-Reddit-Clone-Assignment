# **Week11 Assignment Reflection**

- With the deployment I started off by reading all of the instructions in the README as well as the OAuth documentation and the video on Moodle. Once i knew what everything did, it was much easier to follow the instructions through a second time and get my vercel deployment working.
- As a whole i found it quite challenging to add onto someone elses work as there is always tahat time at the beginning where we have to spend trying to figure out what exactly is happening or going on. In addition to the fact that everyone codes a bit differently
- It was nice to get a snippet of what it would be like working on a larger project that you may have only joined part way through

## Stretch Goals ðŸŽ¯

- As a group we first tried to add an error page and a not-found page to make it a little bit more user friendly
  - We had a coule of issues getting the error page to work as it wouldn't redirect with the link however, we managed to get it working with the reset button in the end
- We also managed to change the title on the tabs by generating metadata for each page
- I had a go at creating a user profile page where the user could see which posts they had done. I got it working to some success i think but we ran out of time to test if it actually worked as i am the old one who currently has any posts

# **Assignment Brief**

## Upvote

Upvote is a Reddit-esque web application that allows users to create posts, upvote and downvote posts, and comment on posts in a multi-threaded, nested list.

The project is built using Next.js with the /app router and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and uses [Auth.js (formerly Next Auth)](https://authjs.dev/) for user authentication. The data is stored in a Postgres database, which is created and accessed with raw SQL queries using the `pg` package.

The project is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

## Features

- [x] View a list of posts
- [x] View a single post
- [x] Create a post
- [x] Upvote and downvote posts
- [x] Pagination of posts
- [x] Comment on posts
- [x] Nested comments (recursive lists)
- [x] User authentication

## Setup instructions

1. Fork the repository (check "copy the main branch only") and clone your fork to your local machine
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - the URL of your Postgres database (eg. the Supabase connection string)
   - `AUTH_SECRET` - the Next Auth secret string (this can be anything at all like a password, but keep it secret!)
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` - the GitHub OAuth client ID (create yours in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers))
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` - the GitHub OAuth client secret (create this in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers))
4. Create the database schema by running the SQL commands in `schema.sql` in your database (eg. by running the commands in Supabase Query Editor)
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site

## Potential future features

- [ ] User settings (eg. number of posts per page, theme, etc.)
- [ ] Moderation tools / reporting or flagging objectionable comments for removable by admins
- [ ] Searching posts (possibly using simple SQL LIKE '%some search%', or [Postgres text search](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-full-text-search-a-search-engine-in-a-database))
- [ ] Subreddits (separate communities, that isn't just one big list of posts, that can be created by users)
- [ ] User notifications
- [ ] User private messaging
- [ ] User blocking
- [ ] User following
- [ ] User feed (posts from users you follow)
